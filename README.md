*Sky to Soil: Satellites Restoring the Shannon*

## Introduction

Picture the Shannon Basin—Ireland's beating heart—where thousands of waterbirds glide over wetlands slowly disappearing under scrub and pollution. Now, imagine blending local know-how with the power of space. Satellites like NASA's Landsat and ESA Sentinel-2 can help us watch over the basin, spotting problems early to turn the tide on habitat loss. This vision transforms the Shannon into a living lab for innovation, where every pixel of data from space nurtures wildlife and empowers communities.

## Background

The Shannon Basin, a biodiversity hotspot spanning 19 counties, faces severe habitat loss from pollution, poor water management, and scrub encroachment. Sites like the Lower River Shannon and estuary wetlands, home to over 50,000 birds, are rated "unfavourable–inadequate" [1]. Landsat and Sentinel-2, updated every 2-3 days, can track habitat changes, inform local decisions, and spark ecological renewal.

## Problem Statement

How can freely available satellite data help local communities restore lost habitats in the Shannon Basin?

## Expected Outcomes

- An interactive map to monitor and optimize vegetation recovery.
- AI alerts identifying pollution hotspots and predictive technology.
- Scalable models applicable to other basins worldwide.

## Difficulty

Intermediate—requires basic satellite image processing and data analysis skills.

## Scope

**Included:** Upland grazing zones, estuary wetlands, riparian areas.  
**Excluded:** Marine or non-space hardware solutions.

## Resources

- **Satellite Data:** NASA's Landsat and ESA's Sentinel-2—free, powerful tools to track Shannon Basin changes [2].
- **Tech Tools:** Google Earth Engine for analysis [3].
- **Partners:** Shannon Chamber, National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and local community forums for collaboration.

## Inspiration

- Shannon Airport's Thady's Hill grazing project—proof of local restoration [4].
- EU Water Framework Directive—success in river basin management [5].

## Why It Matters

The Shannon Basin loses 65+ hectares of priority habitats annually, threatening €1.5 billion in ecosystem services and local jobs [6]. Satellite data offers scalable, low-cost monitoring to reverse this trend.

## Target Areas

- **Estuary (Limerick/Clare):** Vital feeding and nesting grounds for birds.
- **Inland Wetlands (Offaly):** Health of floodplain plants to sustain vibrant wetlands.

## Impact

Using satellite data and local action, restore 10–20% of key habitats, revive wildlife, and boost eco-tourism.

## Motivation

I’m passionate about using tech creatively to build reusable tools that support nature and its stewards, turning the Shannon into a global model.

## Stakeholder Engagement

- **Local Communities & NGOs:** Co-create tools to protect jobs, traditions, and beloved landscapes.
- **Government & Agencies:** Achieve water and habitat goals faster and cheaper.
- **Researchers & Startups:** Leverage open data and funding for innovative solutions.

## Roadmap

1. **Discovery (Weeks 1-4):** Prototype maps in Google Earth Engine; validate with local surveys.
2. **Validation (Months 2-6):** Pilot with NPWS in SAC areas; seek Enterprise Ireland funding.
3. **Scaling (Months 7-12):** Expand basin-wide; develop tourism AR apps with Waterways Ireland.
4. **Growth (Year 2+):** Replicate across EU basins; measure significant habitat gains.
