*Sky to Soil: Satellites Restoring the Shannon*

## Introduction

Picture the Shannon Basin Ireland's beating heart, where thousands of waterbirds glide over wetlands that are slowly disappearing under scrub and pollution.
Now, imagine combining that local know-how with the power of space. Satellites like NASA's Landsat and Sentinel-2 can help us watch over the basin, we can spot problems early, and turn the tide on habitat loss. We can make the Shannon Basin not just a home for wildlife, but a living lab for innovation, where every bit of data from space helps nature and local communities.

## Background

The Shannon Basin is a biodiversity hotspot which spans across 19 counties and is facing severe habitat loss from pollution, poor water management and scrub encroachment.

Sites like the Lower River Shannon and estuary wetlands, which are home to over 50,000 birds are rated as "unfavourable–inadequate."

Landsat and Sentinel-2, updated every 2-3 days could track habitat changes, inform local decisions and encourage ecological renewal.

## Problem Statement

How can freely available satellite data help local communities restore lost habitats in the Shannon Basin?

## Expected Outcomes

- An interactive map to help monitor and optimise vegetation recovery
- AI alerts identifying pollution hotspots and predictive technology
- Scalable models applicable to other basins around the world

## Difficulty

Intermediate — It will require basic satellite image processing and data analysis skills.

## Scope

**Included:** Upland grazing zones, estuary wetlands, riparian areas.

**Excluded:** Marine or non space hardware solutions

## Resources

- **Satellite Data:** NASA's Landsat and ESA's Sentinel-2 which are free, powerful tools to track changes in the Shannon Basin.
- **Tech Tools:** Google Earth Engine for analysis
- **Partners:** Shannon Chamber, National Parks and Wildlife Service, and local community forums which might be willing to collaborate and support your ideas.

## Inspiration

- Shannon Airport's Thady's Hill grazing project (proof of local restoration).
- EU Water Framework Directive (river basin management success).

## Why It Matters

The Shannon Basin loses 65+ hectares of priority habitats annually. As a knock on effect this is threatening €1.5 billion in ecosystem services and many local jobs. Satellite data will provide scalable and low cost methods of monitoring.

## Target Areas

- **Estuary (Limerick/Clare):** Important feeding and nesting grounds for birds.
- **Inland Wetlands (Offaly):** Checking health of floodplain plants, which would help keep the wetlands vibrant and full of life.

## Impact

By using satellite data and local action, you can help restore 10–20 important habitats, bring back wildlife, and boost eco tourism.

## Motivation

I want to use tech in creative ways to build tools that help the environment and can be reused again and again. I hope to support nature and those who care for it.

## Stakeholder Engagement

- **Local Communities & NGOs:** Work together to create tools that protect jobs, traditions, and the places you love.
- **Government & Agencies:** Meet water and habitat goals faster, smarter, and for less cost.
- **Researchers & Startups:** Tap into open data and funding to turn big ideas into real solutions.

## Roadmap

1. **Discovery:** Prototype maps in Google Earth Engine; validate the idea with local surveys.
2. **Validation:** Pilot with Nation parks and wildlife services in SAC areas. Apply for Enterprise Ireland funding.
3. **Scaling:** Expand basin wide. Develop tourism focused AR apps with Waterways Ireland.
4. **Growth:** Replicate across EU basins. Measure large-scale habitat gains.
